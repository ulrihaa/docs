{% note info %}

For a load balancer to run, make sure there are subnets in all availability zones even if you are not going to accept traffic in them. If any availability zone is missing subnets, [create](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) them. To do this, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_create-new_female }}**.
