A disk snapshot only contains the data that had already been written to the disk when the snapshot was created. If the disk is attached to a running VM, the OS and app cache will not be included in the snapshot.

To ensure the integrity of the snapshot data:

{% list tabs %}

- Linux

   1. Stop all disk write operations in applications.

   1. Write the OS cache to the disk:

      ```bash
      sync
      ```

   1. Freeze the file system:

      ```bash
      sudo fsfreeze --freeze <mount_point>
      ```
      Where `--freeze` is the parameter to freeze the file system. Instead of `<mount_point>`, specify the folder the file system is connected to, e.g., `/mnt/vdc2`.

   1. Create a snapshot following the guide [below](#create).

   1. Unfreeze the file system:

      ```bash
      sudo fsfreeze --unfreeze <mount_point>
      ```
      Where `--unfreeze` is the parameter to unfreeze the file system. Instead of `<mount_point>`, specify the folder the file system is connected to, e.g., `/mnt/vdc2`.

- Other OS's

   1. Stop the virtual machine (see [{#T}](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#stop)).
   1. Wait until the VM status changes to `STOPPED`.
