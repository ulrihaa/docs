## Sharing {{ ml-platform-name }} resources {#share}

{{ ml-platform-name }} resources are assigned to the [project](../../datasphere/concepts/project.md) in which they were created. However, communities enable you to use resources from a project in other projects. This helps you save your time and money on new resource creation.

Project administrators can share their project resources among the members of their administered communities (in the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.access }}** tab on the resource page). The resource will then appear among the community resources and all community members will be able to use it in their projects.
