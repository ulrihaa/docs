### Prepare the infrastructure {#deploy-infrastructure}

{% list tabs %}

- Manually

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. If you do not have a [network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) yet, [create one](../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).
   1. If you do not have any [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet), [create them](../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in the [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) where your [{{ managed-k8s-full-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster) and [node group](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#node-group) will be created.
   1. [Create service accounts](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md):
      * For resources with the [{{ roles-editor }}](../../resource-manager/security/index.md#roles-list) [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) for the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where your {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster will be created. The resources the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster needs will be created on behalf of this account.
      * For nodes with the [{{ roles-cr-puller }}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#cr-images-puller) and [{{ roles-cr-pusher }}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#cr-images-pusher) roles for the folder with the [Docker image](../../container-registry/concepts/registry.md) [registry](../../container-registry/concepts/docker-image.md). This service account will be used by the {{ managed-k8s-name }} nodes to push the Docker images that you build to {{ GL }} and pull them to run [pods](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#pod).

      {% note tip %}

      You can use the same [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) for both operations.

      {% endnote %}

   1. [Create a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/kubernetes-cluster/kubernetes-cluster-create.md#kubernetes-cluster-create) and a [node group](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/node-group/node-group-create.md). When creating a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster, specify the previously created service accounts for the resources and nodes.
   1. [Configure security groups](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/connect/security-groups.md) for the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster to run.
   1. [Configure the default security group](../../managed-gitlab/operations/connect.md) required for the [{{ mgl-name }} instance](../../managed-gitlab/concepts/index.md#instance) to run.
   1. [Create a registry in {{ container-registry-full-name }}](../../container-registry/operations/registry/registry-create.md).
   1. [Create an authorized key](../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md) for the service account with the `{{ roles-cr-pusher }}` role and save it to the `key.json` file:

      ```bash
      yc iam key create \
        --service-account-name <service_account_name> \
        --output key.json
      ```

      This key is required to access the registry from {{ GL }}.

- Using {{ TF }}

   1. {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}
   1. Download the [file with provider settings](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/tree/master/tutorials/terraform/provider.tf). Place it in a separate working directory and [specify the parameter values](../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#configure-provider).
   1. Download the [k8s-and-registry-for-gitlab.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/blob/master/tutorials/terraform/managed-kubernetes/k8s-and-registry-for-gitlab.tf) configuration file to the same working directory.

      This file describes:
      * [Network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
      * [Subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
      * [Default security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) and rules needed to run the [{{ mgl-name }} instance](../../managed-gitlab/concepts/index.md#instance).
      * [Security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) and rules required for running the [{{ managed-k8s-full-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster).
      * {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster.
      * [Service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) required for the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster and [node group](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#node-group).
      * [{{ container-registry-full-name }}](../../container-registry/) [registry](../../container-registry/concepts/registry.md).
      * [Authorized key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/key.md) for the service account. This key is required to access the registry from {{ GL }}.
      * Local `key.json` file with authorized key data.
   1. In the `k8s-and-registry-for-gitlab.tf` file, specify:
      * [Folder ID](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md).
      * [{{ k8s }} version](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/release-channels-and-updates.md) for the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster and node groups.
      * Name of the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster service account.
      * Name of the {{ container-registry-name }} registry.
   1. Run the `terraform init` command in the directory with the configuration file. This command initializes the provider specified in the configuration files and enables you to use the provider resources and data sources.
   1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.
   1. Create the required infrastructure:

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

{% endlist %}

{% note warning %}

For applications running in production environments, make sure to restrict access of {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster service accounts to pushing Docker images to a registry. This is required for security reasons. In that case, create a separate service account with the `{{ roles-cr-pusher }}` role and specify it for deploying applications.
