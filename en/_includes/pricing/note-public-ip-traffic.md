You are charged for outgoing traffic from public IPs, including when public IPs are used for internal {{ yandex-cloud }} traffic, except for accessing {{ objstorage-full-name }}, {{ backup-full-name }}, and {{ cdn-full-name }}. To avoid paying for outgoing traffic within your cloud, use internal IPs.
