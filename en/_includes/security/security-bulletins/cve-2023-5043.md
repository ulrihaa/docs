NGINX

### Vulnerable products and versions {#vulnerable-products-and-versions}

### Recommendations for vulnerability detection and additional materials {#recommendations-for-vulnerability-detection}

Here is what we recommend in order to avoid exploiting these vulnerabilities:

1. Update NGINX Ingress Controller to 1.9.0; this version has annotation validation, while the custom snippets are disabled by default.

1. Add the `--enable-annotation-validation` argument to the controller startup options.

1. Add the `strict-validate-path-type` option to `Configmap`.

1. Use a policy engine, such as [Kyverno](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/marketplace/products/yc/kyverno), to validate the paths used in the Ingress rules. You can find [this ready-to-use policy](https://kyverno.io/policies/nginx-ingress/restrict-ingress-paths/restrict-ingress-paths/) on the Kyverno website.

### Safe version of vulnerable product or patch {#safe-version}

The vulnerability has been fixed as of version 1.9.0.

### How it impacts {{ yandex-cloud }} services {#impact-on-yandex-cloud-services}

These vulnerabilities are irrelevant when using {{ yandex-cloud }} ALB Ingress Controller, as it is based on different technologies and does not have any annotations or settings that may lead to such vulnerabilities.
