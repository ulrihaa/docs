* `secret`: [Server key](../../smartcaptcha/concepts/keys.md).
* `token`: One-time token received after passing the check.
* `ip`: IP address of the user that originated the request to validate the token. This is an optional parameter, but we ask you to provide the user IP when making requests. This helps improve {{ captcha-name }} performance.
