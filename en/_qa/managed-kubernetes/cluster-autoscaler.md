# Questions and answers about node group autoscaling in {{ managed-k8s-name }}

#### Why are there N nodes in my cluster now, but the cluster is not scaling down? {#not-scaling-down}

[Autoscaling](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/autoscale.md) does not stop nodes with [pods](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#pod) that cannot be evicted. The scaling barriers include:
* Pods whose eviction is limited with [PodDisruptionBudget](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/node-group/node-drain.md).
* Pods in the `kube-system` [namespace](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#namespace):
   * That were not created under the [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) controller.
   * That do not have `PodDisruptionBudget` or whose eviction is limited by `PodDisruptionBudget`.
* Pods that were not created under a replication controller ([ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), or [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)).
* Pods with `local storage`.
* Pods that cannot be evicted anywhere due to limitations. For example, due to lack of resources or lack of nodes matching the [affinity or anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) selectors.
* Pods with an annotation that disables eviction: `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "false"`.

{% note info %}

`Kube-system` pods, pods with `local-storage`, and pods without a replication controller can be evicted. To do this, set the `"safe-to-evict": "true"` annotation:

```bash
kubectl annotate pod <pod name> cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict=true
```

{% endnote %}

Other possible causes include:
* The [node group](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#node-group) has already reached its minimum size.
* The node is idle for less than 10 minutes.
* During the last 10 minutes, the node group has been scaled up.
* During the last 3 minutes, there was an unsuccessful attempt to scale down the node group.
* There was an unsuccessful attempt to stop a certain node. In this case, the next attempt occurs in 5 minutes.
* The node has an annotation that prohibits stopping it on scale-down: `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled": "true"`. You can add or remove an annotation using `kubectl`.

   Check for annotation on the node:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe node <node name> | grep scale-down-disabled
   ```

   Result:

   ```bash
   Annotations:        cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled: true
   ```

   Set the annotation:

   ```bash
   kubectl annotate node <node name> cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled=true
   ```

   Remove the annotation by running the `kubectl` command with `-`:

   ```bash
   kubectl annotate node <node name> cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled-
   ```

#### Why does the node group fail to scale down after the pod deletion? {#not-scaling-pod}

If the node is underloaded, it is removed in 10 minutes.

#### Why isn't autoscaling performed even when the number of nodes gets less than the minimum or greater than the maximum? {#beyond-limits}

Autoscaling will not violate the preset limits, but {{ managed-k8s-name }} does not explicitly control the limits. Upscaling will only trigger if there are pods in the `unschedulable` status.

#### Why do **Terminated** pods remain in my cluster? {#terminated-pod}

This happens because the [Pod garbage collector (PodGC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-garbage-collection) fails to delete these pods during autoscaling. For more information, see [Deleting Terminated pods](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/autoscale.md#delete-terminated).
