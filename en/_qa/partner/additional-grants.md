# Additional grants in the partner program

#### What is the purpose of additional grants? {#additional-grants}

The program is aimed at helping partners launch their business of providing services to customers in {{ yandex-cloud }}. To facilitate the partner businesses, we give grants. Within the first six months of obtaining partner status, you can receive two types of temporary grants under the program:

* Grant for your customer's pilot
* Grants under the partner support programs

#### What is the grant for your customer's pilot? {#pilot-grant}

The grant for a pilot is credited to a customer subaccount.

{% note info %}

A subaccount is an additional account for a customer's billing account. It is created automatically when you link your customer's account to your account on the partner portal. It is displayed both in your {{ yandex-cloud }} account's console and the customer's console.

{% endnote %}

#### How do I get a pilot grant for my customer's subaccount? {#get-pilot-grant}

Send a request to the support team with the following information:

* Customer's billing account.
* Brief description of the solution and what the pilot is designed for.
* Deadlines for the pilot.
* List of required services.
* Requested grant amount in rubles.
* Customer's subaccount linked to your account.

We will review your request and notify you of our decision on the grant and its terms (amount, validity period, and crediting period).

#### Which grants are issued under the partner support program? {#support-grant}
