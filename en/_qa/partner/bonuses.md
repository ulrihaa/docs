# Partner bonus program

#### What is a partner bonus? {#bonus}

A partner bonus is a discount on {{ yandex-cloud }} services applied to the payment invoice issued to the {{ yandex-cloud }} partner's billing account at the end of month. The certificate, payment invoice, and invoice issued to the partner indicate the final amount including the discount.

#### What determines the discount amount, the way it is credited, and how it is calculated? {#discount}

The discount amount depends on the total monthly consumption of {{ yandex-cloud }} services by all [subaccounts](../../partner/terms.md#sub-account) linked to the partner billing account.

You can link a customer subaccount to a partner account on the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}). Linking a subaccount is grounds for crediting a bonus. It is displayed on the partner portal, in the partner's {{ yandex-cloud }} management console, and in the linked customer's management console.

Linked subaccounts cannot see the partner discount in the management console. {{ yandex-cloud }} does not issue separate payment invoices to subaccounts.

For more information about the discount amount, see the [Partner Agreement](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_grant/?lang=en).

#### What is not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#no-bonus}

The discount does not apply to:
* Service usage in the partner account.
* Grants credited to subaccounts.
* Resources from {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ marketplace-name }}.

You can see the absolute and relative discount amount for the reporting month in the **Rewards** section on the partner portal.

#### Why are resources from {{ yandex-cloud }} {{ marketplace-name }} not included when calculating a partner bonus? {#marketplace}

{{ yandex-cloud }} sells {{ marketplace-name }} services with a minimum margin or with no margin at all. Therefore, we cannot provide an additional discount on solutions from {{ marketplace-name }} images.
