The `storage.admin` role is intended for managing Object Storage. Users with this role can:

* Create buckets.
* Delete buckets.
* Assign an access control list (ACL).
* Manage any bucket object.
* Manage any bucket website.
* Configure other bucket parameters and objects in the bucket.

This role enables the user to grant other users access to a bucket or a specific object in it.

This role can be assigned by the administrator of the cloud (the `admin` role).
