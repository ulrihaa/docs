The `storage.uploader` role enables you to upload objects to a bucket and overwrite previously uploaded ones. Since the `storage.uploader` role inherits the permissions of the `storage.viewer` role, it also grants permission to list bucket objects and download them.

This role does not allow you to delete objects or configure buckets.
