# Connecting to {{ objstorage-name }} from {{ vpc-name }}

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you can connect to [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/) via the appropriate [API endpoint](../../api-design-guide/concepts/endpoints.md) whose FQDN is then translated to a public IP using the DNS service.

This article describes how to deploy a cloud infrastructure in {{ yandex-cloud }} to set up access to {{ objstorage-name }} for resources that are hosted in a {{ vpc-short-name }} [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) and have no public IPs or access to the internet through a [NAT gateway](../../vpc/concepts/gateways.md).

After the solution is deployed in {{ yandex-cloud }}, the following resources will be created:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `s3-vpc` | Cloud network with the resources access to {{ objstorage-name }} is set up for. For deployment, you can specify an existing cloud network as well. |
| `s3-nlb` | [Internal network load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/nlb-types.md) that is responsible for accepting traffic to {{ objstorage-name}}. The load balancer accepts TCP traffic with destination port 443 and distributes it across resources (VMs) in a target group. |
| `s3-nat-group` | Load balancer [target group](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) with VM instances that have the NAT function enabled. |
| `nat-a1-vm`, `nat-a2-vm`, `nat-b1-vm`, and `nat-b2-vm` | NAT instances in the `{{ region-id }}-a` and `{{ region-id }}-b` [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) used for routing traffic to {{ objstorage-name }} and back with translation of IP addresses for traffic sources and targets. |
| `pub-ip-a1`, `pub-ip-a2`, `pub-ip-b1`, and `pub-ip-b2` | VM public IPs to which the {{ vpc-short-name }} cloud network translates their internal IPs. |
| `DNS zone and A record` | Internal [DNS zone](../../dns/concepts/dns-zone.md) `{{ s3-storage-host }}.` in the `s3-vpc` network with an `A` [resource record](../../dns/concepts/resource-record.md) that maps the `{{ s3-storage-host }}` domain name to the IP address of the internal network load balancer. |
| `s3-bucket-<...>` | [Bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) in {{ objstorage-name }} |
| `s3-subnet-a` and `s3-subnet-b` | Cloud [subnets](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) to host the NAT instances in the `{{ region-id }}-a` and `{{ region-id }}-b` availability zones. |
| `test-s3-vm` | Test VM to verify access to {{ objstorage-name }} |
| `test-s3-subnet-a` | Cloud subnet to host the test VM |

For the cloud network with the resources hosted in [{{ dns-name }}](../../dns/concepts/), the `{{ s3-storage-host }}.` internal DNS zone and an `A` resource record are created. The A record maps the `{{ s3-storage-host }}` domain name of {{ objstorage-name }} to the IP address of the [internal network load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/nlb-types.md). With this record, traffic from the cloud resources to {{ objstorage-name }} will be routed to the internal load balancer that will distribute the load across the NAT instances.

To deploy the NAT instances, use a [NAT instance based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/nat-instance-ubuntu-22-04-lts) image from {{ marketplace-name }}. It provides translation of source and target IPs to ensure traffic routing to the {{ objstorage-name }} public IP.

By placing the NAT instances in multiple [availability zones](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md), you can ensure fault-tolerant access to {{ objstorage-name }}. By increasing the number of NAT instances, you can upscale the solution when the load grows. When calculating the number of NAT instances, consider the [locality of traffic handling by the internal load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/specifics.md#nlb-int-locality).

[{{ objstorage-name }} access policies](../../storage/concepts/policy.md) allow actions with buckets only from the public IPs of NAT instances. Bucket access is only granted to the cloud resources using this solution. You cannot connect to a bucket in {{ objstorage-name }} via a public API endpoint. You can disable this limitation in the {{ TF }} configuration file, if required.

### Test results for NAT instance throughput {#speed-test}

The solution was tested on a single NAT instance with the following [configuration](../../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md):

* Platform: Intel Ice Lake (`standard-v3`)
* Performance level: 100%
* vCPU cores: 2
* RAM: 2 GB

The average {{ objstorage-name }} traffic processing speed was 250 MB/s, both egress and ingress.

The test was performed using the [warp](https://github.com/minio/warp) tool on VM instances that could access {{ objstorage-name }} through this solution. The `warp` command used for the test had the following parameters:

```bash
warp get \
  --host {{ s3-storage-host }} \
  --access-key <static_key_ID> \
  --secret-key <secret_key> \
  --tls \
  --bucket <bucket_name> \
  --obj.randsize \
  --concurrent 20 \
  --warp-client <IP_adresses_of_warp_clients>
```

## Recommendations for solution deployment in the production environment {#recommendations}

* When deploying your NAT instances in multiple availability zones, set an even number of VMs to evenly distribute them across the availability zones.
* When selecting the number of NAT instances, consider the [locality of traffic handling by the internal load balancer](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/specifics.md#nlb-int-locality).
* Once the solution is deployed, reduce the number of NAT instances or update the list of availability zones in the `yc_availability_zones` parameter in the pre-scheduled period of time only. When the changes are being applied, traffic handling may be interrupted.
* By default, buckets in {{ objstorage-name }} can be accessed via the {{ yandex-cloud }} [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). You can revoke this permission using the `bucket_console_access = false` parameter.
* If you omit the `mgmt_ip` parameter when `bucket_private_access = true`, solution deployment using {{ TF }} on a workstation will fail with a bucket access error.
* If you are using your own DNS server, create `A` resource records in its settings, such as:

   | Name | Type | Value |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | `{{ s3-storage-host }}` | `A` | `<internal_load_balancer_IP>` |
   | `<bucket_name>.{{ s3-storage-host }}` | `A` | `<internal_load_balancer_IP>` |

* Save the `pt_key.pem` private SSH key used to connect to the NAT instances to a secure location or recreate it separately from {{ TF }}.
* Once the solution is deployed, SSH access to the NAT instances will be disabled. To enable access to the NAT instances over SSH, add a rule for incoming SSH traffic (`TCP/22`) in the `s3-nat-sg` [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) to allow access only from certain IP addresses of admin workstations.

## Deployment plan {#deploy-plan}

To deploy the solution and test it:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#prepare-cloud)
1. [Prepare an environment for deploying the resources](#setup-environment)
1. [Deploy the solution](#deploy)
1. [Test the solution](#check)

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#prepare-cloud}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support costs include:

* Fee for using {{ objstorage-name }} (see [{{ objstorage-full-name }} pricing](../../storage/pricing.md)).

1. Initialize {{ TF }}:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

1. Check the list of created cloud resources:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

1. Create resources:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

1. Once the `terraform apply` process is completed, the command line will output information required to connect to the test VM and test operations with {{ objstorage-name }}. You can then view this information by running the `terraform output` command.

   {% cut "Information about resources deployed" %}

   | Name | Description | Sample value |

   {% endcut %}

## Test the solution {#check}

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder where the resources were created.
1. Select **{{ compute-name }}**.
1. Select `test-s3-vm` from the list of VMs.
1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.switch_console }}** tab.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.console.connect }}**.
1. Enter the `admin` username and the password from the `terraform output test_vm_password` command output (without quotation marks).

1. Run this command:

   ```bash
   dig {{ s3-storage-host }}
   ```

1. Check that the {{ objstorage-name }} domain name in the DNS server response corresponds to the IP address of the internal load balancer. The output of the `A` resource record is:

   ```text
   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   {{ s3-storage-host }}. 300    IN      A       10.10.1.100
   ```

1. Get an object from the bucket in {{ objstorage-name }} using the [AWS CLI](../../storage/tools/aws-cli.md). The bucket name will be fetched from the test VM environment variable.

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
   s3 cp s3://$BUCKET/s3_test_file.txt s3_test_file.txt
   ```

   Result:

   ```bash
   download: s3://<bucket-name>/s3_test_file.txt to ./s3_test_file.txt
   ```

1. You can additionally run a number of commands to test {{ objstorage-name }}. The bucket name will be fetched from the test VM environment variable.

   Upload the downloaded test file to the bucket under a different name:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
   s3 cp s3_test_file.txt s3://$BUCKET/textfile.txt
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   upload: ./s3_test_file.txt to s3://<bucket-name>/textfile.txt
   ```

   Get a list of objects in the bucket:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
   s3 ls --recursive s3://$BUCKET
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   2023-08-16 18:24:05         53 s3_test_file.txt \
   2023-08-16 18:41:39         53 textfile.txt
   ```

   Delete the object you uploaded to the bucket:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url=https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
   s3 rm s3://$BUCKET/textfile.txt
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   delete: s3://<bucket-name>/textfile.txt
   ```

## Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To delete the resources you created using {{ TF }}, run the `terraform destroy` command.

{% note warning %}

{{ TF }} will permanently delete all the resources that were created while deploying the solution.
