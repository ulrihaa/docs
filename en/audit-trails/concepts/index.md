# {{ at-full-name }} overview

{{ at-full-name }} allows you to collect audit logs at the configuration and service level for {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and upload them to {{ objstorage-name }} buckets, {{ yds-name }} streams, or {{ cloud-logging-name }} log groups:

* [Uploading audit logs to a bucket](../operations/index.md#bucket).
* [Uploading audit logs to Cloud Logging](../operations/index.md#logging).
* [Uploading audit logs to a data stream](../operations/index.md#data-streams).

Collecting audit logs enables you to use analytical tools and promptly respond to {{ yandex-cloud }} events:

* [Searching audit logs in a bucket](../tutorials/search-bucket.md).
* [Searching audit logs in a log group](../tutorials/search-cloud-logging.md).
* [Exporting audit logs to SIEM systems](./export-siem.md).
* [Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }}](../tutorials/alerts-monitoring.md).

## Management audit logs {#control-plane-logs}

{{ at-name }} collects [management (control plane)](./control-plane-vs-data-plane.md#control-plane-events) audit logs for the following {{ yandex-cloud }} services:

* {{ alb-full-name }}
* {{ at-full-name }}
* {{ certificate-manager-full-name }}
* {{ dns-full-name }}
* {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}
* {{ compute-full-name }}
* {{ iam-full-name }}
* {{ kms-full-name }}
* {{ lockbox-full-name }}
* {{ mch-full-name }}
* {{ mgl-full-name }}
* {{ mmg-full-name }}
* {{ managed-k8s-name }}
* {{ mmy-full-name }}
* {{ mpg-full-name }}
* {{ mrd-full-name }}
* {{ network-load-balancer-full-name }}
* {{ objstorage-full-name }}
* {{ org-full-name }}
* {{ resmgr-full-name }}
* {{ vpc-full-name }}
* {{ ydb-full-name }}
* {{ yq-full-name }}

The following [management events](./events.md) are logged:

* Logins by federated users
* Creating/deleting service accounts
* Creating/deleting keys of service accounts
* Editing user roles and service accounts
* Creating/deleting resources
* Editing resource settings
* Stopping/restarting a resource
* Changing access policies
* Creating/editing security groups
* Actions with encryption keys and secrets

## Data audit logs {#data-plane-logs}

{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview-by-request.md) %}

{{ at-name }} collects [data (data plane)](./control-plane-vs-data-plane.md#data-plane-events) audit logs for the following {{ yandex-cloud }} services:

* {{ dns-full-name }}
* {{ lockbox-full-name }}
* {{ kms-full-name }}
* {{ objstorage-full-name }}

The following [data events](events-data-plane.md) are logged:

* Execution result of a DNS query from a Cloud DNS client.
* Accessing the contents of a secret.
* Decrypting ciphertext using a key.
* Encrypting a text string with a key.
* Generating a high-entropy key for Envelope Encryption.
* Decrypting ciphertext with a previous-version key and re-encrypting the decrypted text with a new version of the same key.
* Updating an object's ACL in a bucket.
* Creating an object in a bucket.
* Deleting an object from a bucket.
* Deleting bucket object tags.
* Updating bucket object tags.
* Updating an object in a bucket.

## Current service limits {#known-restrictions}

The audit log does not capture authentication errors. For example, if a user makes an API call without an IAM token, this information will not be included in the audit logs.

The log captures authorization errors. For example, if a user attempts to create a resource without sufficient privileges, the log will include an error message.

The service has [quotas and limits](limits.md).

If you upload audit logs to a log group or a data stream, make sure their size is both within the {{ at-name }} limits and the [{{ cloud-logging-full-name }}](../../logging/concepts/limits.md) and [{{ yds-full-name }}](../../data-streams/concepts/limits.md) limits. If the limits are exceeded, information in event audit logs that are large in size will be incomplete.

We also recommend uploading audit logs to the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket.
