Electronic document management is used for the electronic exchange of documents that are signed with a qualified electronic signature (advanced e-signature).

The EDM service can be used by businesses and individual entrepreneurs that are residents of Russia.

{{ yandex-cloud }} sends unilateral [reports](./act.md) using electronic document management. Once you sign the notice of document receipt in the EDM system, the document flow is considered completed.
