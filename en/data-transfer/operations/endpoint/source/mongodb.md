# Configuring a {{ MG }} source endpoint

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [editing](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mmg-full-name }} cluster](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).


## {{ mmg-name }} cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you need the [`{{ roles.mmg.viewer }}` role](../../../../managed-mongodb/security/index.md#mmg-viewer) or the primitive [`viewer` role](../../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#viewer) issued for the folder hosting a cluster of this managed database.

{% endnote %}


Connecting to the database with the cluster ID specified in {{ yandex-cloud }}. Available only for clusters deployed in [{{ mmg-full-name }}](../../../../managed-mongodb/).

- CLI

   * Endpoint type: `mongo-source`.

- {{ TF }}

   * Endpoint type: `mongo_source`.

   Example of the configuration file structure:

   
   ```hcl

     name = "<endpoint_name>"
     settings {
       mongo_source {
         security_groups = ["<list_of_security_group_IDs>"]
         subnet_id       = "<subnet_ID>"
         connection {
           connection_options {
             mdb_cluster_id = "<cluster_ID>"
             auth_source    = "<database_name>"
             user           = "<username>"

## Additional settings {#additional-settings}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoCollectionFilter.collections.title }}**: Data is only transferred from listed collections. All collections are transferred by default.

      {% include [Description for Included collections](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/fields/mongodb/description-included-collections.md) %}

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoCollectionFilter.excluded_collections.title }}**: Data is transferred from all collections except the specified ones.

- {{ TF }}

   * `secondary_preferred_mode`: If there are replicas in the cluster, they will be used for data reads instead of the master host.

   * `collections`: Data is only transferred from listed collections. All collections are transferred by default.

      {% include [Description for Included collections](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/fields/mongodb/description-included-collections.md) %}

   * `excluded_collections`: Data is transferred from all collections except the specified ones.

{% endlist %}

If a source is experiencing high workload (over 10000 write transactions per second), we recommend that you select these settings to have no more than ten different databases at each endpoint. This will help avoid database connection errors while the transfer is ongoing.

{% note info %}

1. If you use several endpoints, you need to create a separate transfer for each one.
1. As transfers of [timeseries collections]({{ mg.docs.comd }}/core/timeseries-collections/) are not supported, you should exclude these collections.
