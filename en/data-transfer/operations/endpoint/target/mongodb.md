# Configuring a {{ MG }} target endpoint

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [editing](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mmg-full-name }} cluster](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).


## {{ mmg-name }} cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you need the [`{{ roles.mmg.viewer }}` role](../../../../managed-mongodb/security/index.md#mmg-viewer) or the primitive [`viewer` role](../../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#viewer) issued for the folder hosting a cluster of this managed database.

- Management console

   Connecting to the database with the cluster ID specified in {{ yandex-cloud }}. Available only for clusters deployed in [{{ mmg-full-name }}](../../../../managed-mongodb/).

   {% include [Managed MongoDB](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/necessary-settings/ui/managed-mongodb.md) %}

- CLI

   * Endpoint type: `mongo-target`.

   {% include [Managed MongodDB CLI](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/necessary-settings/cli/managed-mongodb.md) %}

- {{ TF }}

   * Endpoint type: `mongo_target`.

   {% include [Managed MongodDB Terraform](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/necessary-settings/terraform/managed-mongodb.md) %}

   Example of the configuration file structure:

   
   ```hcl
   resource "yandex_datatransfer_endpoint" "<endpoint_name_in_{{ TF }}>" {
     name = "<endpoint_name>"
     settings {
       mongo_target {
         security_groups = ["<list_of_security_group_IDs>"]
         subnet_id       = "<subnet_ID>"
         connection {
           connection_options {
             mdb_cluster_id = "<cluster_ID>"

## Additional settings {#additional-settings}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoTarget.database.title }}**: Specify the database name if you want to create collections in a database that is different from the source database.

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoTarget.cleanup_policy.title }}**: Select a way to clean up data in the target database before the transfer:

      * `{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.common.console.form.common.CleanupPolicy.DISABLED.title }}`: Select this option if you are only going to do replication without copying data.

      * `{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.common.console.form.common.CleanupPolicy.DROP.title }}`: Completely delete tables included in the transfer (used by default).

         Use this option so that the latest version of the table schema is always transferred to the target database from the source whenever the transfer is activated.

      * `{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.common.console.form.common.CleanupPolicy.TRUNCATE.title }}`: Delete only the data from the tables included in the transfer but leave the schema.

         Use this option if the schema in the target database differs from the one that would have been transferred from the source during the transfer.

- {{ TF }}

   * `database`: Specify the database name if you want to create collections in a database that is different from the source database.

   * `cleanup_policy`: Select a way to clean up data in the target database before the transfer:

      * `DISABLED`: Do not clean up.

         Select this option if only replication without copying data is performed.

      * `DROP`: Completely delete collections included in the transfer (default).

         Use this option so that the latest collection version is always transferred to the target database from the source whenever the transfer is activated.

      * `TRUNCATE`: Delete only the data from the collections included in the transfer but leave the collections.

         Use this option if the structure of collections in the target database differs from the one that would have been transferred from the source during the transfer.

{% endlist %}

{% note warning %}

By default, {{ data-transfer-name }} transfers collections without sharding. If you are transferring data to a sharded target cluster and want your collections to be sharded:

1. [Prepare the target cluster](../../prepare.md#target-mg) to shard the collections.
1. Select `DISABLED` or `TRUNCATE `as your cleanup policy.

Selecting the `DROP `policy will result in the service deleting all the data from the target database, including sharded collections, and replacing them with new unsharded ones when a transfer is activated.
