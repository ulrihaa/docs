# Communities in {{ ml-platform-name }}

_Communities_ represent a way to organize team work in {{ ml-platform-name }}. A community determines the scope of projects and resources and helps set up team activities.

Roles determine what the community members can do. A community member may be a _developer_ or an _administrator_. To view a full list of the community members, see the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.members }}** tab. A developer can create projects and their resources in the community and run calculations in the IDE. A community administrator can invite new members to the community and manage their roles, change the [payment information](#billing), and share resources with other community members. For more information about roles in {{ ml-platform-name }}, see [{#T}](../security/index.md).

You can [link](../operations/community/link-channel.md) a Slack or Telegram channel to your community so that its members can communicate.

To create resources and run projects in the IDE, link a {{ yandex-cloud }} [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) to the community. To learn how to do it, see [{#T}](../operations/community/link-ba.md).
