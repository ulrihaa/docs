# Special terms for educational institutions

{{ yandex-cloud }} offers a free tier for educational institutions and scientific projects. You can learn more about this program [here](/datasphere-education-program).

The following limits apply to {{ ml-platform-name }} communities created under the Computer Science Program to Promote Education and Research:

* The use of high-performance [computing resource configurations](configurations.md) is limited.
* You cannot change the [project storage](project.md#storage) size.
* You cannot update certain project runtime parameters.
* You cannot create [clusters from {{ dataproc-name }} templates](data-proc-template.md).
* You cannot [deploy models](deploy/index.md) using nodes and aliases.

All the above limits are marked with a special ![freetier-lock](../../_assets/datasphere/lock-yellow.svg) icon in the interface.

If you need to switch to the full-featured {{ ml-platform-name }} version, you can do that without creating a new community. In this case, all resources, projects, and computations will be retained, while the free tier mode restrictions will be removed. To switch to the full-featured version, contact your educational institution supervisor or the [support team]({{ link-console-support }}).
