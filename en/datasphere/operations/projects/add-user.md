# Adding a user to a project

{% include [select-user](../../../_includes/datasphere/organization-users.md) %}

1. {% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-find-project.md) %}

1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.project-page.tab.members }}** tab.

1. {% include [select-user](../../../_includes/datasphere/select-from-list.md) %}

   If the required user is not on the list, click **{{ ui-key.yc-ui-datasphere.common.copy-link }}** and send them the copied link in any convenient way.

   Once the user accepts the invitation and follows the link, they become a member of the project.

   {% note alert %}

   The link does not expire. We recommend that you sometimes recreate the link so that users who have been removed from the project could not join it again.

   {% endnote %}
