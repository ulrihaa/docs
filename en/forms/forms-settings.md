If you need the form in another language:

## Move a form to a different account or organization

A form can be moved to a different account or organization only upon request from the form creator to the [technical support](feedback.md).

Form creators can move their forms only in the following cases:

* They are moving a personal form to an organization they belong to.
* They are moving a [business form](forms-for-org.md) to a different account and both the source and target accounts belong to the same organization.

You cannot convert a business form to a personal form.
