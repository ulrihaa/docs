# Getting started with {{ iam-short-name }}

To get started with {{ iam-short-name }}, add a user to your organization and grant them access to a resource in one of your clouds. [Learn more about organizations, resources, and users](../overview/roles-and-resources.md).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}


1. Log in to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). If you do not have an account yet, go to the management console and follow the guide.
1. Make sure that you have the required [roles](./concepts/access-control/roles.md):

   1. In the management console, select the appropriate cloud from the list on the left. For example:

      ![image](../_assets/resource-manager/switch-cloud-n-n.png)

   1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.resource-acl.label_access-bindings }}** tab.
   1. Specify your account in the search bar.
   1. Check that your account has the following roles:

      * Organization owner (`organization-manager.organizations.owner`) or organization administrator (`organization-manager.admin`).
      * Cloud owner (`resource-manager.clouds.owner`) or cloud administrator (`admin`).

1. On the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.navigation-menu.label_billing }}**]({{ link-console-billing }}) page, make sure you have a [billing account](../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) linked and it has the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status. If you do not have a billing account yet, [create one](../billing/quickstart/index.md#create_billing_account).
1. If you do not have any users to add to the cloud, you can [create a new account](https://passport.yandex.com/registration) on Yandex and grant this account access to the cloud.



## Add a user with a Yandex account to your organization {#add-organization-member}

{% include [add-useraccount](../_includes/organization/add-useraccount.md) %}

{% note info %}

You can also invite users to your organization directly, from your cloud page in the management console. For more information, see [this guide](./operations/users/create.md#add-useraccount).

{% endnote %}

To grant a user access to a cloud resource, assign the user a role to the resource itself or to a resource container, such as a folder.


## Assign roles to the user {#assign-role}

To specify which operations the user can perform, assign relevant roles to the user. For example, allow the user to view cloud resources and manage a folder:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. Assign the user a role in the cloud:

      {% include [set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console](../_includes/resource-manager/set-accessbinding-user-viewer-cloud-console.md) %}

   1. Assign the user a role in the folder:

      {% include [set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console](../_includes/resource-manager/set-accessbinding-user-editor-folder-console.md) %}

{% endlist %}


## Revoke assigned roles {#revoke-roles}

If the user no longer needs the assigned roles, revoke them:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   * To revoke a role only in the folder:

      {% include [update-access-binding-user-console-folder](../_includes/resource-manager/update-access-binding-user-console-folder.md) %}

   * To revoke a role in the cloud:

      {% include [update-access-binding-user-console-cloud](../_includes/resource-manager/update-access-binding-user-console-cloud.md) %}

{% endlist %}
