# Load generators

_A load generator_ is a tool that allows you to simulate the load on a service based on a given configuration. The testing tool in {{ load-testing-name }} uses the Pandora and Phantom load generators.

## JMeter {#jmeter}

[JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is an open-source tool forÂ web app testing. It can run tests with complex scenarios. It supports the following protocols:

* FTP
* HTTP
* IMAP
* JDBC
* JMS
* LDAP
* POP3
* SOAP
* TCP

## Pandora {#pandora}

Pandora is the main load generator in {{ load-testing-name }}. Pandora is written in Go and can support more than 100,000 concurrent connections and generate a load of up to 90,000 simple requests per second. Pandora features built-in testing tools for the following protocols:

* gRPC
* HTTP/2
* HTTP(S)

You can use Pandora as a framework for developing custom versions. This allows you to generate a scenario-based load and to load most protocols that have client libraries written in Go (such as WebSocket, PostgreSQL, or DNS).

## Phantom {#phantom}

A low-level generator for loading applications over HTTP and HTTPS. It can generate more than 100,000 requests per seconds and support more than 50,000 concurrent connections to a service. It uses vCPU and memory efficiently, but may require a large disk size. To generate the load, Phantom saves all the payloads to be sent to the service during load testing to the disk.
