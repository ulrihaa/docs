# Managing {{ ES }} extensions

{% include [Elasticsearch-end-of-service](../../_includes/mdb/mes/note-end-of-service.md) %}

User extensions are any text data (dictionaries of words, word breaks, and so on), keys for integration with other clusters, and other data for cluster performance. For more information, see the [{{ ES }} documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-plugins-guide.html).

## Retrieving a list of installed user extensions {#list}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get a list of cluster extensions, run the following command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} extensions list --cluster-id <cluster_ID>
   ```

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To get a list of installed user extensions, use the [list](../api-ref/Extension/list.md) REST API method for the [Extension](../api-ref/Extension/index.md) resource or the [ExtensionService/List](../api-ref/grpc/extension_service.md#List) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   {% include [get-cluster-id](../../_includes/managed-elasticsearch/get-cluster-id.md) %}

{% endlist %}

## Adding or updating user extensions {#add}

{% note info %}

All extensions must be in TXT format and added to a ZIP archive.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To add or update a user extension, run this command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} extensions create --cluster-id <cluster_ID> \
      --name <extension_name> \
      --uri <URI_of_ZIP_archive_with_extension> \
      --disabled
   ```

   In the command, specify the following parameters:

   * `--cluster-id`: Cluster ID. You can [get it with a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
   * `--name`: Extension name. If a previously added extension is specified, it is updated:

      * The extension version number is increased by one.
      * A new extension version is uploaded via the link in the `--uri` parameter and a new ID is assigned to it.

   
   * `--uri`: [Link](../../storage/operations/objects/link-for-download.md) to a ZIP archive with {{ objstorage-full-name }} extension files. You can [configure](./s3-access.md) access to {{ objstorage-full-name }} using your service account.


   * `--disabled`: User extension status. Provide this parameter to disable the new version of a user extension immediately after it is added or updated. Do not set this parameter to enable it. When the new extension version is enabled, the old one is disabled automatically.

- API

   To add or update a user extension, use the [create](../api-ref/Extension/create.md) REST API method for the [Extension](../api-ref/Extension/index.md) resource or the [ExtensionService/Create](../api-ref/grpc/extension_service.md#Create) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:
   * Cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter.

      {% include [get-cluster-id](../../_includes/managed-elasticsearch/get-cluster-id.md) %}

   * Extension name in the `name` parameter. If a previously added extension is specified, it is updated:

      * The extension version number is increased by one.
      * A new extension version is uploaded via the link in the `uri` parameter and a new ID is assigned to it.

   
   * [Link](../../storage/operations/objects/link-for-download.md) to a ZIP archive with extension files in {{ objstorage-full-name }}, in the `uri` parameter. You can [configure](./s3-access.md) access to {{ objstorage-full-name }} using your service account.


   * Status of the user extension in the `disabled` parameter. Once added, it can be disabled with the `true` value and enabled with the `false` value. When the new extension version is enabled, the old one is disabled automatically.

{% endlist %}

## Enabling or disabling user extensions {#update}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To enable or disable a user extension, run this command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} extensions update <extension_ID> \
      --cluster-id <cluster_ID> \
      --active
   ```

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of folder clusters](cluster-list.md#list-clusters) and the extension ID with a [list of cluster extensions](#list).

   To enable an extension, provide the `--active` parameter. To disable one, do not set it.

- API

   To enable or disable a user extension, use the [update](../api-ref/Extension/update.md) REST API method for the [Extension](../api-ref/Extension/index.md) resource or the [ExtensionService/Update](../api-ref/grpc/extension_service.md#Update) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * Cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter.

      {% include [get-cluster-id](../../_includes/managed-elasticsearch/get-cluster-id.md) %}

   * ID of the user extension in the `extensionId` parameter. To get the ID, [retrieve a list of installed user extensions](#list).
   * Status of the user extension in the `active` parameter: `true` for enabled and `false` for disabled.

{% endlist %}

## Deleting user extensions {#delete}

{% list tabs %}

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To delete an extension, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-es }} extensions delete <extension_ID> \
      --cluster-id <cluster_ID>
   ```

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of folder clusters](cluster-list.md#list-clusters) and the extension ID with a [list of cluster extensions](#list).

- API

   To delete a user extension, use the [delete](../api-ref/Extension/delete.md) REST API method for the [Extension](../api-ref/Extension/index.md) resource or the [ExtensionService/Delete](../api-ref/grpc/extension_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * Cluster ID in the `clusterId` parameter.

      {% include [get-cluster-id](../../_includes/managed-elasticsearch/get-cluster-id.md) %}

   * ID of the user extension in the `extensionId` parameter. To get the ID, [retrieve a list of installed user extensions](#list).

{% endlist %}
