# Connecting to a database

Because the {{ GP }} DBMS is based on {{ PG }}, the same tools are used to connect to both DBMSs.

You can connect to a {{ mgp-short-name }} cluster only via the [primary master host](../concepts/index.md). To identify host roles, get a [list of hosts in the cluster](./hosts/cluster-hosts.md#list-hosts).

You can connect to a cluster:

{% include [cluster-connect-note-monolithic](../../_includes/mdb/cluster-connect-note-monolithic.md) %}


## Configuring security groups {#configuring-security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-connect.md) %}

To ensure {{ mgp-name }} cluster functionality and network connectivity between its hosts, you need at least one cluster security group to include rules allowing any incoming and outgoing traffic from any IPs using any protocol.

Rule settings depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs %}

- Over the internet

   {% include [Cluster security group rules](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/cluster-sg-rules.md) %}

- With a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }}

   1. {% include [Cluster security group rules](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/cluster-sg-rules.md) %}

   1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to enable connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and the cluster hosts.

      For example, you can set the following rules for a VM:

      * For incoming traffic:
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `22`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_tcp }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

         This rule allows you to connect to the VM over SSH.

      * For outgoing traffic:
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `{{ port-any }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_any }}` (`Any`)
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-destination }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

         This rule allows all outgoing traffic, which enables you to both connect to the cluster and install the certificates and utilities the VMs need to connect to the cluster.

## Automatic primary master host selection {#automatic-master-host-selection}

To automatically select a host to connect to a cluster, use a [special primary master FQDN](#fqdn-master).

## Getting an SSL certificate {#get-ssl-cert}

To use an SSL connection, get a certificate:

{% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/install-certificate.md) %}

{% include [ide-ssl-cert](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-ssl-cert.md) %}

## {{ GP }} host FQDN {#fqdn}

To connect to a master host, you need its fully qualified domain name ([FQDN](../concepts/network.md#hostname)). You can obtain it in one of the following ways:

* [Request a list of cluster hosts](hosts/cluster-hosts.md#list-hosts).
* In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), copy the command for connecting to the cluster. This command contains a list of FQDNs for master hosts. To get the command, go to the cluster page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.overview.button_action-connect }}**.
* Look up the FQDN in the management console:

   1. Go to the cluster page.
   1. Go to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}**.
   1. Copy the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.host_column_name }}** column value.

Primary master hosts also use [special FQDNs](#fqdn-master).

## Special primary master FQDN {#fqdn-master}

If you do not want to manually connect to another master host when the current one becomes unavailable, use a special FQDN of the `c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` format. It always points to the primary master host in the cluster. Connection to this FQDN is permitted and both read and write operations are allowed.

Here is an example of connecting to a primary master host in a cluster with the ID `c9qash3nb1v9********`:

```bash
psql "host=c-c9qash3nb1v9********.rw.{{ dns-zone }} \
      port={{ port-mgp }} \
      sslmode=verify-full \
      dbname=<DB_name> \
      user=<username>"
```

## Connecting to cluster hosts from graphical IDEs {#connection-ide}

{% include [ide-environments](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-envs.md) %}

You can only use graphical IDEs to connect to a public cluster using SSL certificates.

{% include [note-connection-ide](../../_includes/mdb/note-connection-ide.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

* DataGrip

   1. Create a data source:

      1. Select **File** → **New** → **Data Source** → **{{ GP }}**.
      1. On the **General** tab:

         1. Specify the connection parameters:

            * **User**, **Password**: DB user's name and password.
            * **URL**: Connection string. Use the [special primary master FQDN](#fqdn-master):

               ```http
               jdbc:postgresql://c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}:{{ port-mgp }}/<DB_name>
               ```

{% endlist %}

## Connecting from {{ pgadmin }} {#connection-pgadmin}

The connection has been checked for [{{ pgadmin }}](https://www.pgadmin.org) ver. 7.1 on macOS Ventura 13.0 and Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 21H1.

You can only use {{ pgadmin }} to connect to public cluster hosts [using SSL certificates](#get-ssl-cert).

Create a new server connection:

1. Select **Object** → **Register** → **Server...**
1. On the **General** tab, in the **Name** field, specify the name for the cluster. This name will be shown in the {{ pgadmin }} interface. You can set any name.
1. In the **Connection** tab, specify the connection parameters:

   * **Host name/address**: [Special master host FQDN](#fqdn-master) or regular host FQDN.
   * **Port**: `{{ port-mgp }}`.
   * **Maintenance database**: Name of the `postgres` maintenance database.
   * **Username**: Username for connection.
   * **Password**: User password.

1. In the **Parameters** tab:

   * Set the **SSL mode** parameter to `verify-full`.
   * Add a new **Root certificate** parameter and specify the path to the saved SSL certificate file in it.

1. Click **Save** to save the server connection settings.

As a result, the cluster appears in the server list in the navigation menu.

To monitor the cluster status, use [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](monitoring.md) instead of the **Dashboard** tab in {{ pgadmin }} which might generate an error:

```text
column "wait_event_type" does not exist LINE 10: wait_event_type || ': ' || wait_event AS wait_event, ^
```

This error does not occur in other tabs in {{ pgadmin }}.

## Before you connect from a Docker container {#connection-docker}

To connect to a {{ mgp-name }} cluster from a Docker container, add the following lines to the Dockerfile:

{% list tabs %}


- Connecting without using SSL

   ```bash
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install postgresql-client --yes
   ```


- Connecting via SSL

   ```bash
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install wget postgresql-client --yes && \
       mkdir --parents ~/.postgresql && \
       wget "{{ crt-web-path }}" \
            --output-document ~/.postgresql/root.crt && \
       chmod 0600 ~/.postgresql/root.crt
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Sample connection strings {#connection-string}

{% include [conn-strings-environment](../../_includes/mdb/mgp/conn-strings-env.md) %}

When creating a {{ GP }} cluster, the user database is not created. To test the connection, use the `postgres` service database.

To connect to a publicly accessible cluster, prepare an [SSL certificate](#get-ssl-cert). The examples assume that the `root.crt` SSL certificate is located in the directory:

* `/home/<home_directory>/.postgresql/` for Ubuntu.
* `$HOME\AppData\Roaming\postgresql` for Windows.

You can connect to a cluster using either a master host's regular FQDN or a primary master host's [special FQDN](#fqdn-master). To learn how to get a host FQDN, see [this guide](#fqdn).
