# Audit policy in {{ managed-k8s-name }}

An [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/#audit-policy) establishes the [rules](#rules-audit-policy) that determine which events should be logged to an [audit log](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) and what data they should contain. Audit events are generated by requests to the {{ k8s }} API server at each [stage](#stages) of their execution. The audit policy rules are applied one by one. The first rule corresponding to the event sets the audit event [level](#levels).

## Stages {#stages}

| Stage | Event generation point |
| --- | --- |
| `RequestReceived` | Once the audit event handler receives a request. |
| `ResponseStarted` | After sending response headers but before sending the response body. |
| `ResponseComplete` | After sending the response body. |
| `Panic` | After critical errors occur. |

## Levels {#levels}

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `None` | Do not log any events. |
| `Metadata` | Log the event metadata, excluding the request or response body. |
| `Request` | Log the event metadata and request body without the response body. |
| `RequestResponse` | Log the event metadata, request body, and response body. |

## Audit policy files in {{ managed-k8s-name }} {#rules-audit-policy}

An audit policy file in {{ managed-k8s-name }} looks as follows:

### Descriptions of audit policy rules {#rule-descriptions}

Sample audit policy rules are given below.

#### Rule for the `None` level {#none}

```yaml
- level: None
  users: ["kubelet"] # Legacy kubelet identity.
  verbs: ["get"]
  resources:
    - group: "" # Core.
      resources: ["nodes", "nodes/status"]
```

It means that event details should not be logged if the following conditions are true:
* A request is sent by the `kubelet` component from a [{{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster](../concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster) [node](../concepts/index.md#node-group).
* The request type is `get`.
* The request refers to the `nodes` or `nodes/status` resources.

#### Rule for the `Metadata` level {#metadata}

```yaml
- level: Metadata
  resources:
    - group: "" # Core.
      resources: ["secrets", "configmaps", "serviceaccounts/token"]
    - group: authentication.k8s.io
      resources: ["tokenreviews"]
  omitStages:
    - "RequestReceived"
```

It means that the event metadata should be logged if the following conditions are true:
* The event does not match any of the previous rules in the audit policy.
* The request refers to the `secrets`, `configmaps`, `serviceaccounts/token`, or `tokenreviews` resources.
* The event is not part of the `RequestReceived` stage.

#### Rule for the `Request` level {#request}

```yaml
- level: Request
  userGroups: ["system:nodes"]
  verbs: ["update","patch"]
  resources:
    - group: "" # Core.
      resources: ["nodes/status", "pods/status"]
  omitStages:
    - "RequestReceived"
```

It means that the event metadata and request body should be logged if the following conditions are true:
* The event does not match any of the previous rules in the audit policy.
* A request is sent by a component from the `system:nodes` group.
* The request type is `update` or `patch`.
* The request refers to the `nodes/status` or `pods/status` resources.
* The event is not part of the `RequestReceived` stage.

#### Rule for the `Request` level {#request2}

```yaml
- level: Request
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  resources:
    - group: "" # Core.
    - group: "admissionregistration.k8s.io"
    - group: "apiextensions.k8s.io"
    - group: "apiregistration.k8s.io"
    - group: "apps"
    - group: "authentication.k8s.io"
    - group: "authorization.k8s.io"
    - group: "autoscaling"
    - group: "batch"
    - group: "certificates.k8s.io"
    - group: "extensions"
    - group: "metrics.k8s.io"
    - group: "networking.k8s.io"
    - group: "policy"
    - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
    - group: "scheduling.k8s.io"
    - group: "settings.k8s.io"
    - group: "storage.k8s.io"
  omitStages:
    - "RequestReceived"
```

It means that the event metadata and request body should be logged if the following conditions are true:
* The event does not match any of the previous rules in the audit policy.
* The request type is `get`, `list`, or `watch`.
* The request belongs to a resource group from the list.
* The event is not part of the `RequestReceived` stage.

#### Rule for the `RequestResponse` level {#requestresponse}

```yaml
- level: RequestResponse
  resources:
    - group: "" # Core.
    - group: "admissionregistration.k8s.io"
    - group: "apiextensions.k8s.io"
    - group: "apiregistration.k8s.io"
    - group: "apps"
    - group: "authentication.k8s.io"
    - group: "authorization.k8s.io"
    - group: "autoscaling"
    - group: "batch"
    - group: "certificates.k8s.io"
    - group: "extensions"
    - group: "metrics.k8s.io"
    - group: "networking.k8s.io"
    - group: "policy"
    - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
    - group: "scheduling.k8s.io"
    - group: "settings.k8s.io"
    - group: "storage.k8s.io"
  omitStages:
    - "RequestReceived"
```

It means that the event metadata, request body, and response body should be logged if the following conditions are true:
* The event does not match any of the previous rules in the audit policy.
* The request type is `create`, `update`, or `delete`. This is not specified explicitly, but is clear from the fact that the rule does not apply to the previously specified request types: `get`, `list`, or `watch`.
* The request belongs to a resource group from the list.
* The event is not part of the `RequestReceived` stage.
