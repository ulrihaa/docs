# Creating a {{ OS }} cluster

A {{ mos-name }} cluster is a group of multiple linked {{ OS }} and [Dashboards]({{ os.docs }}/dashboards/index/) hosts. A cluster provides high search performance by distributing search and indexing tasks across all cluster hosts with the `DATA` role. To learn more about roles in the cluster, see [Host roles](../concepts/host-roles.md).

Available disk types [depend](../concepts/storage.md) on the selected [host class](../concepts/instance-types.md).

For more information, see [{#T}](../concepts/index.md).

## Creating a cluster {#create-cluster}

When creating a cluster, you need to specify individual parameters for each [host group](../concepts/host-groups.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   To create a cluster:

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where you want to create a cluster.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_create }}**.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.section_base }}**:

      1. Enter a name for the cluster. It must be unique within the folder.
      1. (Optional) Enter a cluster description.
      1. Select the environment where you want to create the cluster (you cannot change the environment once the cluster is created):

         * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
         * `PRESTABLE`: For testing purposes. The prestable environment isÂ similar to the production environment and is also covered by the SLA. However, it is the first to receive new functionalities, improvements, and bug fixes. In the prestable environment, you can test compatibility of new versions with your application.

      1. Select the {{ OS }} version.
      1. Select the [plugins](plugins.md#supported-plugins) you want to install in the cluster.

   
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.section_network-settings }}**, select the cloud network to host the cluster in and security groups for cluster network traffic. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#security-groups) to connect to the cluster.


   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.opensearch.cluster.node-groups.title_virtual-node-group }} 1**, configure the [`{{ OS }}` host group](../concepts/host-groups.md):

      1. Select the host group type: `{{ OS }}`

      1. Enter a name for the host group, which must be unique within the cluster.

      1. Select the [host roles](../concepts/host-roles.md) `DATA` and `MANAGER`.

      1. Select the platform, host type, and host class.

         The host class defines the technical characteristics of virtual machines that {{ OS }} nodes are deployed on. All available options are listed under [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md).

      1. Select the [disk type](../concepts/storage.md) and data storage size.

         {% include [storages-step-settings](../../_includes/mdb/settings-storages-no-broadwell.md) %}

      1. Specify how hosts should be distributed across availability zones and subnets.

      1. Select the number of hosts to create.

      
      1. Enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.hosts.dialog.field_public_ip }}** if you want to allow [connecting](connect.md) to hosts over the internet.

         {% note tip %}

         It is not recommended to enable public access for hosts with the `MANAGER` role, because this might be unsafe.

         {% endnote %}


      {% note warning %}

      After creating your cluster, you can only change the host configuration using the API. However, you can also create a new host group with a different configuration if needed.

      {% endnote %}

   1. If needed, configure the `Dashboards` [host group](../concepts/host-groups.md) under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.opensearch.cluster.node-groups.title_virtual-node-group }} 2**:

      1. Select the platform, host type, and host class.
      1. Set up storage in the same way as for `{{ OS }}` hosts.
      1. Specify how hosts should be distributed across availability zones and subnets.
      1. Select the number of hosts to create.

      
      1. Enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.hosts.dialog.field_public_ip }}** if you want to allow [connecting](connect.md) to hosts over the internet.

         {% include [mos-tip-public-dashboards](../../_includes/mdb/mos/public-dashboards.md) %}


   1. If required, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.opensearch.cluster.node-groups.action_add-virtual-node-group }}** to add another host group or more.

   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.section_service-settings }}**:

      1. Enter the password for the `admin` user.

         {% include [Superuser](../../_includes/mdb/mos/superuser.md) %}

      1. Configure additional cluster settings, if required:

         {% include [Extra settings](../../_includes/mdb/mos/extra-settings.md) %}

   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.forms.button_create }}**.

- API

   To create a cluster, use the [create](../api-ref/Cluster/create.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Create](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Create) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:

   * ID of the folder where the cluster should be placed, in the `folderId` parameter.
   * Cluster name in the `name` parameter.
   * {{ OS }} version in the `configSpec.version` parameter.
   * `admin` user password in the `configSpec.adminPassword` parameter.
   * Configuration of one or more groups of hosts with the `DATA` and `MANAGER` (optional) [roles](../concepts/host-roles.md) in the `configSpec.opensearchSpec.nodeGroups` parameter.
   * Configuration of one or more groups of hosts with the `DASHBOARDS` [role](../concepts/host-roles.md#dashboards) in the `configSpec.dashboardsSpec.nodeGroups` parameter.
   * List of plugins in the `configSpec.opensearchSpec.plugins` parameter.
   * Settings for access from other services in the `configSpec.access` parameter.
   * Network ID in the `networkId` parameter.

   
   * Security group identifiers in the `securityGroupIds` parameter. You may also need to [set up security groups](connect.md#security-groups) to connect to the cluster.
   * ID of the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) used for cluster operations in the `serviceAccountId` parameter.


   * Cluster deletion protection settings in the `deletionProtection` parameter.

      {% include [Deletion protection limits](../../_includes/mdb/deletion-protection-limits-db.md) %}

   * Settings for the [maintenance window](../concepts/maintenance.md) (including those for disabled clusters) in the `maintenanceWindow` parameter.

{% endlist %}
