# {{ mrd-short-name }} network and DB clusters


When creating a cluster, you can:

* Specify a network for the entire cluster.
* Specify subnets for each host in the cluster.
* Enable TLS support to connect to the cluster from outside {{ yandex-cloud }}.


## Host name and FQDN {#hostname}

{{ mrd-short-name }} generates a name for each cluster host when it is created. This name will be the host's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The host name and, consequently, FQDN cannot be changed.

{% include [see-fqdn](../../_includes/mdb/mrd/fqdn-host.md) %}


You can use the FQDN to access the host within a single cloud network.

## Public access to {#public-access-to-host} cluster hosts

If you create a {{ mrd-short-name }} cluster with TLS support, you can connect to it both from a {{ yandex-cloud }} VM and from the internet.

If you created a cluster without TLS support, you can only connect to it from a {{ yandex-cloud }} VM on the same cloud network. You cannot enable public access to a host in this type of cluster.

Any host in a cluster with TLS support enabled can be accessible from outside {{ yandex-cloud }} if you requested public access when [creating](../operations/hosts.md#add) or [modifying](../operations/hosts.md#update) the host.

You cannot update a public address after creating a host; however, you can replace one of the existing hosts with a new one that has a public address.

When deleting a publicly accessible host, the assigned IP address is revoked.

## Security groups {#security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules-limits](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-limits.md) %}

{% note tip %}

When connecting to a cluster from within its cloud network, make sure to [configure security groups](../operations/connect/index.md#configuring-security-groups) both for the cluster and for the connecting host.
