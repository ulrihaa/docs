# Referral program

A _referral program_ is a program for acquisition of new {{ yandex-cloud }} customers by distributing referral links. The links are unique and allow for partner identification. A partner who has acquired a customer gets a commission for the customer's paid consumption.

Program participants:

* Referrer: Partner company that refers customers to {{ yandex-cloud }}. Only a business that is a resident of the Russian Federation can be a referrer.
* Referral: Acquired customer. This can be either a business or an individual.

## How to participate in the program {#desc}

To become a referrer, make sure your billing account meets the following requirements:

* Billing account type: [Business account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types).
* You registered your business account for a business or individual entrepreneur that is a resident of the Russian Federation.
* The payment method selected in the business account is <q>Bank transfer</q>.
* The business account switched to paid consumption, but the initial grants can still be used.

### Referral sign-up conditions {#condition}

The following are eligible for the referral program:

* New users.
   A user is considered new if they have not previously signed up for {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* Users who have been inactive for more than 32 days.
   A user is considered inactive if their account status was `Suspended` and they did not consume any resources of the services for over 32 days.

A referrer will get a reward, provided that a referral:

1. Follows the referral link and signs up for {{ yandex-cloud }}.

   Specifics of referral link sign-up:

   * If the user closes the browser and then re-opens the same link, the sign-up will be accepted. However, if the user opens the URL without using the referral link, the sign-up will not be accepted.
   * If the user lacks some information at sign-up (phone number or Yandex email address), the registration will be accepted only after the user has supplied the missing information and resumed signing up to {{ yandex-cloud }}.
   * If the user closes the tab and opens the console without using the referral link (for example, {{ link-console-main }}), the sign-up will not be accepted.

1. Gives their consent to share information about their consumption of resources with the referrer for 12 months.
   The referrer only sees the total resource consumption of the referral. This is necessary to ensure the transparency of crediting rewards.

The referrer and referral do not sign any additional agreements for providing {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

If the conditions above are not met, the customer is not considered a participant of the referral program. In this case, the partner does not receive a reward for this customer.

### Reward amount {#sum}

A partner reward amounts to 10% of sales to referrals, including VAT, but no more than ₽100,000 per customer per month. You can track the consumption figures of your referral customers in your [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}) profile.

### Reward payment period per referral {#duration}

A reward for a referral is paid within 12 months of their sign-up via the referral link.

### Crediting rewards {#pay-period}

A reward is given once a month when {{ yandex-cloud }} receives payment for resources consumed by a referral. If a customer didn't consume or didn't pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} resources, no reward is given.

### Ways to receive a reward {#money}

The minimum amount for reward withdrawal is ₽500. There are two ways to get your reward:

1. The reward amounts to 10% of sales to referrals, including VAT.
   If you apply the general tax system, the reward sum will include 20% VAT. You will get an invoice and a report with VAT stated separately to enable you to pay VAT to the budget.
   If you apply the simplified tax system, the reward is not subject to VAT.
1. Transfer the reward amount to a [grant](../../billing/concepts/bonus-account.md) and use it to pay for {{ yandex-cloud }} services.

You can select how you will get your reward on the [partner portal]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).
