# Getting notifications from services in a folder

Users specified under **Service notifications** in the folder settings get notifications from services for specific cloud folders.

To add a user to the list of notification recipients:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-cloud }}), select the folder to configure. If necessary, [switch to another cloud](../cloud/switch-cloud.md).
   1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.switch_service-notifications }}** tab.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.incident-notifications.button_open-dialog }}**.
   1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.incident-notifications.label_subscribers-dialog-header }}** window that opens, select:

      1. Users you want to subscribe to notifications.

         {% note info %}

         You can add users with a [YandexGoogle](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) as well as [federated users](../../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation). Federated users should specify their email address in their account settings.

         {% endnote %}

      1. Services to send notifications to the users.
      1. Methods for delivering notifications to the selected users.

         {% note warning %}

         Email address, phone number, and Telegram channel to receive the messages can be specified in the [notification settings]({{ link-cloud-communications }}).

         {% endnote %}

   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.add }}**.

   In the folder **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.switch_service-notifications }}** section, you can see the users subscribed to the folder notifications by default, because they are subscribed to the parent cloud's notifications. To do this, enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.cloud.incident-notifications.label_inherited-subscribers }}**.

- API

   Currently, you cannot add users to the list of notification recipients using the API.
