# Asynchronously recognizing audio files in LPCM format

Below is an example of [asynchronous recognition of speech](../transcribation.md) from an audio file using the {{ speechkit-name }} [API v2](transcribation-api.md). This example uses the following parameters:

* [Language](../models.md#languages): Russian
* [Language model](../models.md#tags): `general:rc`
* Format of the submitted audio: [LPCM](../../formats.md#LPCM) with a sampling rate of 8000Â Hz
* [Number of audio channels](transcribation-api.md#sendfile-params): 1 (default)
* Other parameters left by default.

You can generate and send a speech recognition request using [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se).

An [IAM token](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) is used to authenticate the service account. Learn more about [authentication in the {{speechkit-name}} API](../../concepts/auth.md).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [transcribation-before-you-begin](../../../_includes/speechkit/transcribation-before-you-begin.md) %}

If you do not have an LPCM audio file, you can download a [sample file](https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/speechkit/speech.pcm).
