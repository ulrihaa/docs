# Access control lists (ACLs)

{{ yandex-cloud }} uses two independent mechanisms for managing access to {{ objstorage-name }} resources:
* [{{ iam-name }}](../../iam/concepts/index.md).
* {{ objstorage-name }} ACL, which is a list of permissions for each object and bucket; it is stored directly in {{ objstorage-name }}.

When receiving a request to a bucket or object, {{ objstorage-name }} checks access permissions through both mechanisms. If the required access is granted from either method, {{ objstorage-name }} executes the request. Permissions granted to a bucket apply to all objects it contains. With ACLs, you can extend access permissions to individual objects.

{% note warning %}

A bucket [inherits](#inheritance) the same access rights in the {{ iam-short-name }} service as those of the folder and the cloud where it is located.

{% endnote %}

> For example, if a user has the `viewer` role in {{ iam-short-name }} for the bucket's folder, they can view its content, even though such permissions are not provided in the bucket ACL.

By default, {{ objstorage-name }} creates an empty ACL for each new object or bucket. Users with the appropriate access rights can edit and upload ACLs for {{ objstorage-name }} buckets and objects.

You can use ACLs to grant permissions to {{ yandex-cloud }} users, service accounts, and system groups. To do this, you need to know the [permission recipient's ID](#accounts-ids). When granting permissions, you can use [predefined ACLs](#predefined-acls), which contain common permission sets.

To view the ACL structure description, see [ACL XML schema](../s3/api-ref/acl/xml-config.md). You can set up to 100 rules per ACL.

{% note info %}

ACLs uploaded for objects are applied immediately. ACLs uploaded for buckets, as well as access permissions updated in the {{ iam-short-name }} service, apply with delay. For more information about delays, see the [{{ iam-short-name }} documentation](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).

{% endnote %}

## Permission recipient ID {#accounts-ids}

* {{ yandex-cloud }} user:

  You can get the ID in the following ways:
  * In the [IAM]({{ link-console-access-management }}) section of the management console.
  * Using the [{{ iam-short-name }} CLI or API](../../iam/operations/users/get.md).
* [Service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts):

   To get the ID, go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.switch_service-accounts }}** section in the management console.

* [System groups](#system-groups):

   Use the system group URI to grant permissions.

## ACL operations {#acl-operations}

* In the management console, you can edit ACLs for [buckets](../operations/buckets/edit-acl.md) and [objects](../operations/objects/edit-acl.md).
* Using an Amazon S3-compatible API, you can [upload or download](../s3/api-ref/acl.md) ACLs for buckets or objects.

   You cannot delete ACLs. To remove all access permissions, upload an empty ACL.

## Permission types {#permissions-types}

Permissions are in line with the user roles in {{ iam-short-name }}.

| Permission | Role in {{ iam-short-name }} | Description |
--- |--- |---
| `READ` | `viewer` | For buckets: Permission to retrieve a list of objects in the bucket, read various bucket settings (lifecycle, CORS, static hosting), and read all objects in the bucket.<br>For objects: Read permission. |
| `WRITE` | `editor` | For buckets: Permission to write, rewrite, and delete objects in the bucket.<br>It must be used with the `READ` permission; you cannot specify `WRITE` separately.<br>For objects: This permission is meaningless, as, when writing an object, the permission is checked for the bucket. |
| `FULL_CONTROL` | `admin` | Full access to objects and buckets. |
| `READ_ACP` | `viewer` | ACL read permission. For objects only. |
| `WRITE_ACP` | `editor` | ACL write permission. For objects only. |

{% note info %}

If you specify the `WRITE` permission without `READ` when creating an ACL, {{ objstorage-name }} will return the `501 Not Implemented` error code.

{% endnote %}

## Predefined ACLs {#predefined-acls}

| ACL | Description |
--- |---
| `private`<br>`bucket-owner-full-control` | {{ yandex-cloud }} users get permissions according to their roles in {{ iam-short-name }}. |
| `public-read` | `AllUsers` system group gets the `READ` permission. |
| `public-read-write` | `AllUsers` system group gets the `READ` and `WRITE` permissions. |
| `authenticated-read` | `AuthenticatedUsers` system group gets the `READ` permission. |

Predefined ACLs can be applied to both objects and buckets. When applied to an object, the `public-read-write` ACL is the same as `public-read`.

You can upload a predefined ACL using only an [Amazon S3-compatible HTTP API](../s3/api-ref/acl.md). When uploading an ACL, use the `X-Amz-Acl` HTTP header.

## System groups {#system-groups}

### AllUsers {#all-users}

This system group includes all internet users.

A permission for `AllUsers` looks as follows:

```
<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group">
    <URI>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers</URI>
</Grantee>
```

### AuthenticatedUsers {#authenticated-users}

This group includes all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users: both from your clouds and other users' clouds.

A permission for `AuthenticatedUsers` looks as follows:

```
<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group">
    <URI>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers</URI>
</Grantee>
```

## Inheritance of bucket access rights by {{ yandex-cloud }} system groups {#inheritance}

A bucket inherits the same access rights in the {{ iam-short-name }} service as those of the folder and cloud where it is located. If a user has access rights to the folder or cloud the bucket belongs to, they will also have access to the bucket itself.

{% note warning %}

Assigning roles to the `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` [system groups](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md) for the folder or cloud the bucket belongs to is the same as granting **public access** to the bucket:
* `allAuthenticatedUsers`: All authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users get access to the bucket, both from your clouds and other users' clouds.
* `allUsers`: Access is granted to all users.

You can grant the same access rights to a bucket by adding access rights for the `AuthenticatedUsers` and `AllUsers` groups to the bucket ACL.

{% endnote %}

### Viewing bucket access rights inherited from folders {#examples}

A bucket inherits access rights from its folder. If you want to know exactly what access rights your bucket inherited, get a list of roles for the folder. You can also revoke these roles at any time.

* To get a list of folder roles, run this command:

  ```bash
  yc resource-manager folder list-access-bindings \
    --id b1g7gvsi89m34qmcm4ke
  ```

  Result:

  ```bash
  +---------+--------------+-----------------------+
  | ROLE ID | SUBJECT TYPE |      SUBJECT ID       |
  +---------+--------------+-----------------------+
  | viewer  | system       | allAuthenticatedUsers |
  | viewer  | system       | allUsers              |
  +---------+--------------+-----------------------+
  ```

  The output contains `allAuthenticatedUsers` and `allUsers`. This means the users of these groups are granted rights for this folder and all resources it contains, including buckets.

* To revoke a role from the `allAuthenticatedUsers` system group, run this command:

  ```bash
  yc resource-manager folder remove-access-binding \
    --id b1g7gvsi89m34qmcm4ke \
    --role viewer \
    --allAuthenticatedUsers
  ```

* To revoke a role from the `allUsers` system group, run this command:

  ```bash
  yc resource-manager folder remove-access-binding \
    --id b1g7gvsi89m34qmcm4ke \
    --role viewer \
    --allUsers
  ```
