## Updates {#top-news}

### Integrations in queue settings {#queue-integrations}
Added a new page, **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_b-page-queue-admin.tab-title--integrations }}**, to the queue settings. You can use it to set up the following integrations:

* [Forms](../manager/forms-integration.md) to create issues based on responses from {{ forms-name }} forms.
* [Email](../manager/queue-mail.md) to send and receive emails right on the issue page.
* [Commits](../user/ticket-links.md#section_commit) to track commits made while completing an issue.

1. Go to the [organizations page]({{ link-tracker }}admin/orgs).
1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_page-admin_ChangeOrganizationModal.add-button }}**.
1. In the window that opens, select an available organization and click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_page-admin_ChangeOrganizationModal.add-button }}**.

You can change both {{ yandex-cloud }} and {{ ya-360 }} organizations.



### New page for connecting repositories {#repository-new-ui}

The new interface now has the [connect repositories page]({{ link-tracker }}admin/repositories).

### Adding a repository on your own server {#repository-personal-server}

You can now [connect a repository](../user/add-repository.md) hosted on your own server without contacting support. To do this, make sure your server is associated with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

To connect a custom repository:
1. Go to the [connect repositories page]({{ link-tracker }}admin/repositories).
1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_admin-repositories_ConnectRepositoryDialog.connect }}**.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_repository-modal.platform }}** field, select the platform your server is connected to.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_admin-repositories_ConnectRepositoryDialog_fields_UrlField.server-url-label }}** field, specify your server address to any repository that can be accessed using a token.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_admin-repositories_ConnectRepositoryDialog.token-label }}** field, enter the token for connecting to your server.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_repository-modal.button--connect }}**.
1. Make sure that the repository status in {{ tracker-name }} is **{{ ui-key.startrek.blocks-desktop_page-admin-tab_type_repositories.status--success }}**.


### Migrating boards to new technologies {#boards-migration}

Starting September 1, 2023, all boards with no migration restrictions were automatically transferred to the [new technologies](../manager/agile-new.md).

You can learn more about the board migration [here](../manager/boards-convertor.md).

### Mermaid support {#mermaid}

You can now add [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams to {{ tracker-name }} issue descriptions and comments. To insert a diagram, open the list of commands using the `/` character and select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/mermaid.svg) **Mermaid**.

## Fixes and improvements {#fixes}

### Fixed a search of issues by field value {#search-filters-fix}

Fixed the filter parameter error that occurred when searching for a selected parameter's value, such as **Status** or **Issue type**. The value being searched for was not displayed in the search results in the event of an exact match.


### Fixed the error that occurred when switching to inactive tabs at an organization change {#organizations-fix}

The fixed error occurred when multiple tabs with {{ tracker-name }} were open in the browser and the user changed the organization in one of them. The context persisted in the open tabs, which caused errors when switching to them.

Now, when navigating across open tabs, the user will see a pop-up window prompting them to stay in the current organization or switch to a new one.


### New project page {#projects-new}

Updated the layout of [project pages](../manager/project-new.md). Their interface is now similar to that of {{ tracker-name}} issues.
