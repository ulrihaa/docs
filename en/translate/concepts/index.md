# {{ translate-full-name }} overview

You can use {{ translate-name }} to integrate [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.ru) algorithms with custom applications and web projects. Yandex Translate supports over 90 languages and can translate both individual words and complete texts.

## Language detection {#detect}

If you do not know the source language of a text, {{ translate-full-name }} will automatically detect it while translating. You can also use it to just [detect the text language](../operations/detect.md).

## Glossaries {#glossaries}

To increase the accuracy of translations on a specific topic, you can [provide a glossary in your request](../operations/better-quality.md#with-glossary). A glossary is a termbase containing words and phrases with a single translation. You can learn more about glossaries [here](glossary.md).
