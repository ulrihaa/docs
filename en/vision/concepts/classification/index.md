# Image classification

_Image classification is currently at the [Preview stage](../../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md)._

This section describes how the _image classification_ feature works.

Use this feature to find out how well an image matches a certain property (for instance, whether the image contains adult content). This can reduce the cost of manual moderation because you will be able to ban such images automatically.

The list of properties the result is returned for depends on the selected model. For example, the `quality` model, which is used to assess the quality of an image, returns the probabilities for the `low`, `medium`, and `high` properties. You can find more information about the supported models [here](supported-models.md).

## Request format {#request-format}

To use the classification feature, specify `CLASSIFICATION` in the feature type and provide the [model](supported-models.md) name:

```json
{
  "folderId": "b1gvmob95yys********",
  "analyze_specs": [{
    "content": "iVBORw0KGgo...",
    "features": [{
      "type": "CLASSIFICATION",
      "classificationConfig": {
        "model": "quality"
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

Only one model can be used within a single analysis feature. If you need to apply more models to your image, provide another object in `features`:

```json
{
  "folderId": "b1gvmob95yys********",
  "analyze_specs": [{
    "content": "iVBORw0KGgo...",
    "features": [{
      "type": "CLASSIFICATION",
      "classificationConfig": {
        "model": "quality"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "CLASSIFICATION",
      "classificationConfig": {
        "model": "moderation"
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Service response {#service-response}

The service returns a list of properties in the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "low", // Property name.
  "probability": 0.71257284 // Probability of matching the property.
}
```

The service returns all properties for the selected model, even if the probability for a property is zero.

**Response example**:

{% include [classification-quality-response](../../../_includes/vision/classification-quality-response.md) %}
