# Formulas, diagrams, and flowcharts

{% include [actions-alert](../_includes/wiki/actions-alert.md) %}

You can embed formulas, sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and graphs in pages that were created in the [old editor](pages-types.md#page).

Use a special text markup to format formulas and diagrams so they are converted into images:

* [Inserting formulas](static-markup/formulas.md)

* [Embedding diagrams, graphs, and flowcharts](static-markup/diagram.md)
