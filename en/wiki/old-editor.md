# Editing a page in the old editor

{% include [edit-page](../_includes/wiki/edit-page.md) %}

In the old editor, you can:
* [Formatting text](basic-markup.md).
* [Add images](add-image.md).
* [Add tables](add-grid.md).
* Add a [table of contents](actions/toc.md), [bookmarks](actions/anchor.md), and [page lists](actions/page-lists.md).
* View your page in the preview mode and split mode.

You can also use more advanced tools:
* [Markdown markup language](static-markup.md)
* [Dynamic blocks](actions.md)
* [Blocks with special formatting](formatter.md)

If needed, you can [convert your page](page-management/convert-page.md) created in the old editor to a page in the [new editor](new-editor.md) format.
