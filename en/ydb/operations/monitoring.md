# Monitoring DB status

DB status details are available in the management console. You can view them on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.ydb.database.switch_monitoring }}** tab of the DB management page or in {{ monitoring-full-name }}.

Diagnostic information about the DB status is presented as charts. The chart update period is 1 minute.

{% include [note-monitoring-auto-units](../../_includes/mdb/note-monitoring-auto-units.md) %}


You can [configure alerts](#monitoring-integration) in {{ monitoring-full-name }} to receive notifications about DB failures. In {{ monitoring-full-name }}, there are two alert thresholds: `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_warn }}` and `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_alarm }}`. If the specified threshold is exceeded, you will receive alerts via the configured [notification channels](../../monitoring/concepts/alerting.md#notification-channel).


## Viewing monitoring charts {#monitoring-database}

To view detailed information about the {{ ydb-name }} database status:

1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_ydb }}**.
1. Click the name of the desired database and open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.ydb.database.switch_monitoring }}** tab.
1. {% include [open-in-yandex-monitoring](../../_includes/mdb/open-in-yandex-monitoring.md) %}

On the page that opens, you will see the DB status charts.

## Integration with {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

To set up alerts for DB status indicators:

1. [Create an alert](../../monitoring/operations/alert/create-alert.md).
1. Add a status metric.
1. Set the alert threshold values in the alert settings.

For more information about the {{ ydb-name }} status metrics, see the [metric reference](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#ydb).
